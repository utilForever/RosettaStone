  # We don't want statistics for the tests themselves and certainly not for the
  # benchmarks and boost libraries. Note that while we exclude the gcov data for
  # these patterns in the codecov call (codecov --gcov-glob ...), the fact that
  # our code references these areas also means we need to tell codecov itself to
  # ignore them from the stats.
